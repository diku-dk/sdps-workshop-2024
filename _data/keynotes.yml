  abstract: "Event-based systems have become pervasive. Ideas that have been presented and discussed over the years in DEBS are widely adopted in different systems that serve diverse applicative domains. They influenced (and were influenced by) research in various fields of computer science, including research on database systems, programming languages, and knowledge representation.
In this talk, I will overview the evolution of event-based systems over the years to show how rapidly a research field can evolve and how individual research studies can contribute to guide this evolution."

  title: "A selective and biased choice of techniques for building a distributed data store"
  affiliation: Poznan University of Technology, Poland

  anchor: keynote2
  abstract: "Single-machine data stores cannot support the scale and ubiquity of data today. The Internet applications and services must process a huge number of concurrent requests and events per second. So, they use distributed (or replicated) data stores which store and process data on multiple machines, offering key advantages in performance, scalability, and reliability. The purpose of the talk is to present a selective and biased choice of techniques and results which can be used for building an efficient distributed data store. Biased, because I only present solutions and results developed within a research project that I did with my PhD students. Selective, because an exhaustive description would be too exhausting to fit into a single talk. Therefore I will be discussing in detail just the design of our novel database index for key-value data store systems, and only skim our other contributions that are directly related to distributed systems. The index, called Jiffy, has been designed with performance and scalability in mind. Therefore it has been designed as a lock-free concurrent data structure, which can dynamically adapt to the changing workload. It achieves superior performance despite built-in atomic operations (batch updates, snapshots, and range scans). During the talk I will be presenting Jiffy's architecture, the algorithms for inserting and looking up the key-value pairs, and the operations used for resizing the data structure dynamically. The other contributions of our project include: efficient support for replica state recovery after failures, either by extending the classic Paxos consensus algorithm, or through the use of persistent memory, and some surprising theoretical results which are applicable to distributed data store systems that compromise consistency in favour of high availability and speed, but also support operations ensuring strong consistency (which requires consensus among replicas)."

  abstract: "The performance of stream processing systems heavily relies on the ability to move data between stream processing operators efficiently. The softwarization of computer networks offers a huge potential for distributed systems to accelerate the performance of distributed stream processing operators by minimizing data movements and accelerating the execution of operators. Yet, using methods of in-network computing to accelerate middleware services like stream processing systems often conflict with the famous end-to-end principle. Therefore, in this talk, we will focus on abstractions that allow executing computations on heterogeneous resources of network elements and discuss how these abstractions can support stream processing systems. In particular, we highlight and introduce recent findings in distributed data stream processing, network function virtualization, and real-time packet streaming. We show how different paradigms and programming models support accelerating performance by better utilizing the capabilities of in-network computing elements. Moreover, we give an outlook on how future developments can change how distributed computing can be adaptively performed over networked infrastructures."

  abstract: Recent technological advances have enabled the efficient execution of decentralized web3 applications and smart contracts. The Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) is a fast and efficient decentralized blockchain-based system for the execution of general-purpose applications in the form of smart contracts. In particular, the ICP's execution, governance and evolution are controlled by different parties in a trustless and fault-tolerant manner instead of a central entity. In this talk, I will give an overview of the ICP, followed by a discussion of the challenges the IC faces to facilitate upgrading itself through voting by ICP token holders and present our approach to tackle them.

  title: "Metastability in the Metaverse"
  affiliation: Roblox, USA

  abstract: Roblox Metaverse supports an impressive 55M daily users. The underlying infrastructure is geographically distributed, with multiple edge data centers in all continents. The Metaverse stack consists of multiple layers of software systems, with complex dependencies that can be represented as a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) or a multi-layered queueing system. In short, the concept of Metastability happens when each moving part of the stack works in harmony. In contrast, a Metastable failure results from a trigger originating in some part of the stack that cascades through multiple dependencies to finally affect a third-party system. Such kind of failure has large-scale consequences and can deem the overall stack unusable. The present talk will deep-dive in the characterization (or absence) of metastability based on a queueing theory model and analyze the dynamics that can lead to different flavors of system-wide failures. Furthermore, the model will be used as the basis to (mathematically) devise measures for the early detection of failures and explore fault-tolerance measures that ensure metastability.   
  biography: Dr. Tania Lorido-Botran is a Research Scientist at Roblox where she leads several efforts at the intersection of ML and Systems. Prior to that, she worked at Microsoft and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. She was also a visiting PhD at Rice University.

  abstract: "The continuously increasing availability of cloud and edge data center resources is driving our evolution to a data-driven society. Meanwhile, however, the innate sharing of third-party data center resources by users continues to fuel strong security concerns around data and computations handled in and across such infrastructures. While many basic solutions to enforce security have been proposed over the years, both in terms of software mechanisms (cryptographic primitives) and hardware mechanisms (trusted execution environments), they all come with their respective pros and cons. In this talk I will report and reflect on almost a decade of experience of working on the problem of confidentiality-preserving data and event processing. I will cover challenges in terms of guarantees, performance, transparency, or portability and interoperability, discuss tradeoffs therein, solutions, and, finally, open challenges."
