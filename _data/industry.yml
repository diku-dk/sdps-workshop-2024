#  abstract: "In this talk, I will present RisingWave, a distributed SQL streaming database designed for the cloud. RisingWave provides standard SQL as the interactive interface. It speaks in PostgreSQL dialect, and can be seamlessly integrated with the PostgreSQL ecosystem with no code change. RisingWave treats streams as tables and allows users to compose complex queries over streaming and historical data declaratively. RisingWave is designed for the cloud. The cloud-native architecture enables RisingWave to scale compute and storage resources separately and infinitely based on the users’ demands. We open-sourced RisingWave kernel under Apache License 2.0. Together with the open community, we are on the mission to democratize stream processing: to make stream processing simple, affordable, and accessible for everyone."

#  abstract: "Large network data evolving over time have become ubiquitous across most industries,  ranging from automotive and pharma to e-commerce and banking. Despite recent efforts, using temporal graph neural networks on continuously changing data in an effective and scalable way has been a challenge. This talk presents one of the research tracks studied at Euranova. We provide an overview of relevant continual learning methods directly applicable to real-world use cases. As explainability has become the central ingredient in trustworthy AI, we introduce the landscape of state-of-the-art methods designed for explaining node, link or graph level predictions."

#
#  abstract: "Across our business and personal lives, we’re used to getting information in real-time. How many stops until my parcel arrives? Where’s my Uber? Is it faster for me to walk or take the bus? Are there any new videos to watch? We all carry super-computers in our pockets with instant access to all the streaming data we want, customised to our personal preferences. Naturally, financial services professionals in brokerage, trading, and wealth management expect their market data to be real-time as well, allowing them to make split second decisions to buy and sell. But real time market data is hard to provide with sufficient Quality of Information (QoI) and Quality of Service (QoS). It’s massive, constant, and complex. And most days, real-time is much more than people need, even if it is what they ask for. We’ll look at what the real business drivers are for going real-time, when delayed or daily is better, and how to balance the market data needs against the wants."
