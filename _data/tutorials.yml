  abstract: A 101 introduction to Apache Kafka, the de facto standard platform for event streaming. In this talk we will introduce Kafka looking a bit at its internals, how it works and why it works. We'll also introduce a tool to generate random consistent data and have a quick look at several frameworks for real time streaming applications (kstream, ksqlDB, Apache Flink).  
  biography: I have more than 25 years experience in software development and IT industry. I have matured a significant competency in distributed applications, starting in the other century when it wasn't even a buzzword - JINI, anyone? I have worked as a designer, lead architect or coach in many different projects for many different companies. I had the chance to work with a lot of methods, processes and tools and had the opportunity to teach and talk about what I have learned in ILT (Instructor's Led Training) courses, in seminars in front of hundreds of people, at the University as well as on national TV, greatly enhancing my communication skills.
