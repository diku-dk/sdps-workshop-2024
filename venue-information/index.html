            <p>
                Your navigation system is bound to send you along another route, but we recommend you use exit 15, Gevninge. The trip will be approx. 1 minute longer, but it guides you along an easier route away from the many bends and curves of the country roads ,making it the more comfortable and perhaps faster route anyway.
